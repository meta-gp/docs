# Themes

Protocols and guidelines for the analysis of clinical infections and public health applications according to themes covered by `META-GP` and states where the protocols are used.

## Clinical

### Central nervous system infections  

Resources for central nervous system infections (including meningitis, encepahlitis, abscesses) focused on low abundance pathogen detection using unbiased or enriched metagenomics and -transciptomics, as well as host-transcriptome analysis for differentiating infectious from non-infectious aetiology.

> Protocols

* [Wet-lab **protocol**]() for unbiased metagenomics and transcriptomics (`DNA/RNA/NTC`) including unique molecular identifiers and synthetic spike-in controls (VIC)

> Workflows

* Meta-metagenomics and -transcriptomics for comprehensive pathogen detection in low-abundance samples with [**`mgp-cerebro`**]() (VIC)

> Reporting

* Reporting template based on taxonomic aggregation across workflow modules and traceable extraction of evidence with [**`cerebro`**]() (VIC)

> Quality assurance

* Continuous integration of quality assurance using regularly updated databases and automated sensitivity/specificity testing with [**`cerebro`**]() and [**`ciqa`**]() (VIC)
