Welcome to the `META-GP` documentation! This repository is currently **under construction**. 

We are aiming to provide a set of production-grade, accredited protocols for metagenomic diagnostics 
across clinical and public health applications in Australia. This documentation is meant to facilitate
open-source access to protocols, software and workflows currently under development.

* [Themes](themes/index.md)  
Guidelines and resources for themes in `META-GP`.

* [Tools](tools/index.md)  
Softwared developed under the `META-GP` umbrella.

## About

Funded by the Australian Government Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) Pathogen Genomics Flagship, the Metagenomics Platform (Meta-GP) program is a collaboration between Australiaâ€™s leading researchers in pathogen genomics and clinical infectious diseases.

This metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) study is a transformative approach in accredited microbial diagnostics and patient care because it can be used to detect and characterise all known pathogens - bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic - in one single test.

At the conclusion of the `META-GP` program, Australia will have a nationally accessible network of laboratories that can apply metagenomic approaches in patient care to rapidly detect, prevent, and respond to infectious threats, including antimicrobial resistance.

The `META-GP` project aligns with the National Microbial Genomics Framework 2019-2022 strategic priorities and principles by delivering the following objectives:

* the ability to rapidly identify the cause of any infectious disease within a clinically actionable timeframe and hence transform individual patient care

* a clear understanding of the range of microbial pathogens that impose a major disease burden in Australia

* ensure public health surveillance can occur in the face of culture independent diagnostic tests
