# Tools

## Developed for `META-GP`

[`vircov`](vircov.md)  
A tool for computing coverage metrics from alignments including regions of coverage and automated reference selection for re-mapping workflows.

[`scrubby`](scrubby.md)  
A tool for thorough background depletion or extraction of reads using chained k-mer and alignment methods.

[`cerebro`](mgp-cerebro.md)  
A toolkit for the central nervous system workflow (`mgp-cerebro`) including an application programming interface for taxonomic identifications.

## Software dependencies

We rely on a multitude of community-driven, open-source software and databases that many amazing people around the world are tirelessly developing - it is a
privilege to be part of this community.

We have listed all relevant repositories and publications here, along with indications which workflows or tools rely on these dependencies, so that they 
can be appropriately cited in reseach publications that utilize `META-GP`. 

We understand journals often limit citation counts, but we would like to strongly encourage to rage against these policies so that researchers who have 
made their tools available can get the appropriate acknowlegements for their work, which ultimately makes scientific discoveries possible.
